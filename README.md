# SafeQL

An very basic application that demonstrates a solution to the problem of SQL Injection using (randomly generated) Key-appended Keyword Protection.

This project was developed as a mini-project for a Computer Security course.

Download the required packages (using ```pip -r requirements.txt```) and use ```python main.py``` to run the application.

Note: Don't forget to setup the corresponding SQL service as well. The current implementation uses SQLite as a simple backend solution.
